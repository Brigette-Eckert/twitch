#User Stories
```
1. I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.

2.I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.

3.I will see a placeholder notification if a streamer has closed their Twitch account (or the account never existed). You can verify this works by adding brunofin and comster404 to your array of Twitch streamers.
